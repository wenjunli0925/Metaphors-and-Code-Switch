# Metaphors & Code Switch
## Description
This work is part of my practice exploring the invisible network that facilitates communication between humans and machines.

I wondered what the "thing" between complex logic and binary logic (1 & 0) is. In other words, what builds the bridge between natural languages and machine language? Human-wise, it is a set of rules. Computer-wise, it is a set of logic gates. With that help, a gigantic system can be built upon only binary nodes.

Also inspired by various orientational metaphors rooted in our languages - so many things can be described with "up" and "down", which is a binary expression as well, I made this system that aims to understand a human's feelings via a series of binary inputs controlled by hand gestures.

The final output of this system is the changes in its audio.
